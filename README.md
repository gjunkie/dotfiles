# dotfiles

Streamlining my dotfiles... finally.

### Install
Most of the heavy lifting will be handled by the `bin/dotfiles` script. This will will remove your current `.vim` stuff and symlink new ones from this project.
- cd into the `dotfiles` project.
- Run `sudo sh bin/dotfiles`.
- `brew install fzf`

###ViM
Current `colorscheme` is `blame`. In order for this color to work, you must import the `vim/colors/blame.itermcolors` profile into your iTerm.
