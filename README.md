# dotfiles

### Install
- **Note**: This will will remove your current `.vim` folder, `bashrc`, and `bash_profile` and symlink new ones from this project.
- cd into the repo and run `sh install`.
- You will be prompted with several questions to get set up. Initially it will ask you if you want to go through some software install options. These include things like `yarn`, `npm`, `xcode-select`, etc.

### ViM
- Don't forget to check if your color scheme requires you to import its `.itermcolors` profile into iTerm.
- In order for `fzf.vim` to be fully set up you will also need to install `fzf`; do so by running: `brew install fzf`.

### bash
Nothing too fancy here, just some individual files for colors, aliases, and paths.
